Theorem plus_n_0 : forall n:nat, n = n + 0.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - (* n = 0 *) reflexivity.
  - (* n = S n' *) simpl. rewrite <- IHn'. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem minus_diag : forall n,
  minus n n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite -> IHn'. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem mult_0_r : forall n:nat,
  n * 0 = 0.
Proof.
  intros n. induction n as [| n' IHn'].

Theorem plus_n_Sm : forall n m : nat,
  S (n + m) = n + (S m).
Proof.
  intros n m. induction m as [| m' IHm'].
  induction n as [| n' IHn'].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
